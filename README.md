This is the official repository for Pocket Shield Core mod for Keen Software House's "Space Engineers" game.\
This mod will be a part of my "Back to the reality" modpack? challenge?, in which the Engineer stays on Earthlike planet most of their time.

This mod is a framework for adding personal shield generator, the Pocket Shield.\
Any characters (Enginners, Wolves, Spiders, AI Enabled Bots, ...) can benefit from this shield if they have the Shield Emitter item in their inventory.

This mod doean't actually add any item in game. It acts as a framework to handle logic for personal shield. You will have to provide it with needed data to create your own items.\
Example mod can be found [here (Pocket Shield)](https://github.com/3x3y3z3t/Pocket-Shield/tree/v3).
